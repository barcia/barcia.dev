## Coding guy
- I am a mostly self-taught developer with a strong foundation in web technologies.
- I studied design at Instituto Tramontana.
- I'm always eager to learn new things in tech and expand my knowledge.
- After several years working in both product and agency environments, I transitioned to freelancing in the summer of 2024.
- I enjoy developing personal projects and exploring creative solutions.

## AFK
- I'm passionate about photography, especially documentary photography. I spend a lot of time taking, reviewing, and studying photos.
- I also love running through forests and mountains, and I sometimes participate in trail running competitions.
- I have a strong interest in local heritage, especially petroglyphs. I've been learning traditional crafts like weaving baskets and making straw hats, just as my grandparents did.

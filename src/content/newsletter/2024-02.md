## `<hr>` in `<select>`.  
Now, all major browsers support the `<hr>` element inside the `<select>` element to visually create _groups_ or _sections_ of options.

## CSS Scrollbar Properties.  
Chrome has added support for `scrollbar-color` and `scrollbar-width`. This allows us to easily style the scrollbar. However, it is still not supported in Safari.

## Browser Updates.  
In January, all major browsers released a new version. Most significant is that, with the support for `<hr>` in `<select>` in Firefox 122, it is now supported in all major browsers.

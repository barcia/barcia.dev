I have several years of experience working on the web. I am
passionate about everything related to interface creation,
programming, and the development of digital products. My
strongest skills lie in web technologies such as HTML, CSS,
JavaScript, Accessibility, Web Standards, etc., and I have
worked with the main tools associated with these
technologies.

But I don't believe that the tool is the most important
thing. I love trying out new technologies and continuously
learning.

I am also very interested in design, and I don't see the web
development process as always linear. Instead, I believe
that disciplines like design and development should
constantly overlap and provide feedback to each other.
Having knowledge in both disciplines greatly helps me excel
in each of them. I particularly enjoy working with design
systems.

To improve my design skills, I trained at the Tramontana
Institute, and for everything related to the web and
programming, I am mostly self-taught. Design, design
systems.

- Right now I’m working full-time as a Senior Frontend Developer at [AiKit](https://www.linkedin.com/company/aikit-es), a Spanish AI-native company developing products that are set to revolutionize the business sector in the coming months.
- Sometimes I collaborate as a freelance UI Engineer on small but impactful projects with a select group of clients.
- In my spare time, I work on developing some **personal projects**.
- Based near **Santiago de Compostela**, Spain, I have been working remotely for many years, and frequently travel to Madrid.

You can see the tools and gear I use daily on my [uses](/uses) page.

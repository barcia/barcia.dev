- I work fully remotely near Santiago de Compostela, Spain, though I also travel frequently to Madrid.
- I’m a freelance UI Engineer, collaborating with a select group of clients.
- Recently, I’ve been focusing on AI-related projects as well as fintech and wealth management, spending most of my time collaborating with [Tifin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/tifin/).
- In my limited free time, I work on my own projects.

You can see which artifacts I'm currently using in the [uses](/uses) page.

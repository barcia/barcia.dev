		<p>
			I have several years of experience working as UI engineer and front-end developer on the web. My strongest
			skills are creating stunning user interfaces and bridging the gap between engineering and design. I am an
			expert in web technologies and have worked extensively with the main tools and libraries in this field.
		</p>
		<p>
			Currently, the frameworks I specialize in and use to develop front-end projects are Astro, Next.js, and
			Shopify. I can build your website, online store, or app, or I can join your product team as a part-time
			contributor. My approach to work emphasizes order and rigor, simplicity, standards, and a well-crafted
			design.
		</p>
		<p>I'm always looking to collaborate on inspiring projects. Let's talkâ€”I'd love to get to know you!</p>

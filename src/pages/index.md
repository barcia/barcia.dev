Freelance web builder focused on creating visually striking and highly functional user interfaces. Based in northwest Spain.

## How can I help you

I have several years of experience working as UI engineer and front-end developer on the web. My strongest skills are creating stunning user interfaces and bridging the gap between engineering and design. I am an expert in web technologies and have worked extensively with the main tools and libraries in this field.

Currently, the frameworks I specialize in and use to develop front-end projects are Astro, Next.js, and Shopify. I can build your website, online store, or app, or I can join your product team as a part-time contributor. My approach to work emphasizes order and rigor, simplicity, standards, and a well-crafted design.

I'm always looking to collaborate on inspiring projects. Let's talk—I'd love to get to know you!

## Companies I've worked with

FC Barcelona, GitHub, Tifin, Meliã, Levante UD, AiKit, RedRadix, Grow, OpositaTest.

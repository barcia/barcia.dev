## Learning
Currently I am focused primarly on improve my skills on Design, UX and JavaScript


## Side projects
At this moment I am centered on the port some of my websites, like this, from WordPress to a static site generator tool, in this case, [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io) and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) as hosting.


## Reading
Recently I bought *[MÃ¡is que ver: Cen historias do deseÃ±o na Galiza](https://www.amazon.es/gp/product/8491214267/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)* but I will not start it until I finish *A Feast for Crows*.


## Writing
I have many ideas for articles, but I think I will not write in the next weeks until my sites are all ported to Eleventy and Netlify.

## Place
From Portomouro, but currently living in [A CoruÃ±a, Galiza, SPAIN](https://goo.gl/maps/2n6Rx96EGWk).


## Profesional
I am a frontend designer and developer in [OpositaTest](https://www.opositatest.com/).


## Personal
I'm still learning and improving my productivity with GTD. And recently I started running again after a long time.

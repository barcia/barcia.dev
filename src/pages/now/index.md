- I work fully remotely from a rural area near Santiago de Compostela, Spain, though I also travel frequently to Madrid.
- I’m a freelance UI Engineer, collaborating with a select group of clients.
- Recently, I've been focusing on AI-related projects, as well as fintech and wealth management.
- In my limited free time, I work on my own projects.
- Additionally, I’m building a store to sell Galician gourmet products from small local producers.
